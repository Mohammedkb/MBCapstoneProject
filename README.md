===================
----------
This repository contains the code needed to reproduce the Data Science Capstone Project report titled "*Predicting the Usefulness of a Yelp Review Using Machine Learning*".

Due to the huge size of the Yelp raw datasets, and in order to avoid problems related to cache memory during reproducing the report, the code is divided into two .Rmd files:

- DataRead
- MBCapstoneProject

To reproduce the report, first you need to run (*knit*) the **DataRead.Rmd** file, then *knit* the **MBCapstoneProject.Rmd** file.
